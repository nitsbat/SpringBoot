SPRING AOP - Aspect object programming

Aspect object programming basically differs from the basic modular programming where we write methods/procedures for implementing things.
This aspect programming is basically used where we are using same methods or objects in multiple classes. i.e logging,transaction,etc.

e.g - suppose we have a method/function which is been used in Class A,class B,Class C. Now what we can do to make the code better is that
	  take out this method in a different class and then make an object of this class and call the method from all these three classes.
	  But now also there is a problem that all the three classes are instantiating the object and calling the function.
	  
	  In AOP, what happens is that we make a aspect of this method, aspect means a new class only but this class will be connected to a configuration
	  in which we will say that if this method is used by all three classes, then these classes will be configured in that aspect configuration.
	  
STEPS IN AOP 
1) Write Aspects i.e classes
2) Configure where the aspects apply.
